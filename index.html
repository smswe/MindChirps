                  Love is an emotion that has always intrigued me. It is loaded
                  with lot of contrarian feelings- you need the person you love
                  to be possessive about you yet need your space; you need that
                  person to respect your thoughts and let you do things on your
                  course yet you want that person to offer their unsolicited
                  views, and I could go on and on about how this universal
                  feeling called "LOVE" is so unfathomable. Perhaps, this is
                  why, no matter how many movies are done around the central
                  theme of love, new ones with fresh perspective like "Lover"
                  still is celebrated by the audience.

                  'Woman+ Unmarried+ Approaching one's 30s' is a perfect
                  combination that would invite unabated sympathies and advise
                  from one's friends(married) and family. Archana 31 Not Out
                  portrays the life of one such woman, Archana(played by
                  Aishwarya Lekshmi), who struggles to find the right groom for
                  her. And when she eventually thinks she has found one, a twist

                  None likes facing crisis in life but we all know that it is
                  inevitable though it's form and severity may vary. Some crisis
                  could impact self while some like Covid 19 could impact people
                  at large. Darwin's theory of evolution talks about survival of
                  the fittest, which emphasizes on the adaptablity to the
                  adverse situations as a quintessential quality to live to see
                  another day. This theory is very much and all the more
                  relevant in present scenario given the VUCA (volatile,
                  uncertain, complex and ambiguous) nature of the world. But
                  what are the essential qualities, you may wonder. Thanks to
                  the authors T N Hari and Sanjay Swami....

                  The movie's storyline is very straight forward: How travel can
                  change one's outlook about life. Of late, in Kollywood cinema,
                  this pattern can be seen where there is a depressed
                  person(men, mostly) who would climb on their Royal Enfield
                  bike and then set off to the Himalayan mountains; when they
                  return, they become a refined soul. So, is this movie any
                  different from the stereotypical portrayal?! Ah, you can't get
                  to the verdict right in the first paragraph :D

                  It's a common saying which goes like 'Marriages are made in
                  Heaven'; but we all know that the couple should still lead
                  their lives on (beautiful yet complicated) Earth!! All of us
                  want and yearn for a happy, peaceful, fun filled and
                  satisfying married life and a partner who would support,
                  defend, and handhold us in this journey. But very rarely do we
                  come across couples who have achieved this stature. This book
                  'Row, Row, Row your Boat' is a book written by couple
                  therapists, Sophia and Roopak(a couple themselves!!), who
                  turned around their married life which was on the verge of
                  collapse with therapy's help. This is a short but insightful
                  read on little things that couples could do 'together' to
                  reach their vision of becoming a made-for-each-other couple,
                  which apparently was their original vow when they got married
                  but may have fizzled out as years passed by.

                  Let's assume this situation. You are working in a reputed
                  organization and your appraisal is underway. You have high
                  hopes of getting a sizeable increment with a promotion to a
                  leadership role. All of a sudden, your manager invites you
                  into his room and asks you to poach some information to a
                  competitor firm for some illegal commission. Would you be okay
                  doing this so that your appraisal sails through, which will
                  also keep you in your manager's good books or would you back
                  off as you would be hurting the organization for illegal short
                  term again. This is just an example of one of plethora of
                  daily dilemmas that life throws at you with varying
                  complexities. This book by Hardayal Singh, a civil service
                  Officer, attempts to highlight through fictional and real
                  stories of common men, that choosing and walking along the
                  righteous path with an unwavering mind is possible but
                  acknowledges that it is extremely difficult.

                Hello! Welcome to Sammy's MindChirps. I'm glad you are here. To
                me, the word LIFE is an acronym of Laboratory with Infinite
                Freedom to Experiment. It's more like a kaleidoscope offering
                amazing learning opportunities as we grow and explore various
                facets of life. So this blog is a platform where I share
                anything that I find interesting (with my two cents, of course
                :D). I assure that you will have some new learning when you exit
                the blog. And do share your feedback on the blog or anything you
                want me to write about in this blog by dropping an email to
                mindchirps@gmail.com
